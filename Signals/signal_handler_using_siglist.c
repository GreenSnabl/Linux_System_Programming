/*  
* printf(); fprintf(); sprintf()
*
*  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38832230/copy-paste-in-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows
*
*  in a nutshell:
*  printf(..) == fprintf(stdout,...)
*  sprintf writes formated text to a char array instead of writting it to a stream
*
*
* exit()
*  The C library function void exit(int status) terminates the calling process immediately.
*  Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed and any children of the process 
*  are inherited by process 1, init, and the process parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.
